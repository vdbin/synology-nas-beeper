# Disable UPS beeper (USB) in Synology NAS

Small script to disable / enable the beeper sound from a USB connected UPS in Synology DiskStation Manager.

Based on [this post](https://moshib.in/2019/02/08/disable-ups-beeper-synology.html)
from [Moshi's Blog](https://moshib.in).

Some time ago the power went off at 4am for a long time and I had to get up and shutdown the UPS in order to stop the
beeping. The abovementioned post describes how to disable it permanently. Still, I did not want it to stop beeping
during day time. The next steps and scripts are my solution to disable and enable the beeping during specific parts of
the day (in my case between 00h and 09h).

**Important:** DSM updates seem to remove the scripts under /root/ and rollback the upsd.users file to its original
state. If you update DSM you have to repeat the process.

## Intro

In most Linux distros there is a set of tools to manage an UPS. Namely:

* `upsc` - the ups client, which can be used to query details about the ups
* `upsd` - the service / daemon
* `upscmd` - command line tool used to send commands and change settings

### Some examples:

List available UPSes:

```shell
user@nas:/$ upsc -l
ups
```

List all variables and values from a specific ups:

```shell
panda@calvin:/$ upsc ups
battery.charge: 100
battery.type: PbAc
device.mfr: EATON
(...)
ups.beeper.status: enabled
(...)
```

View a specific field/variable:

```shell
panda@calvin:/$ upsc ups ups.beeper.status
enabled
```

Both `upsc` and `upscmd` communicate with the `upsd` using a client/server model (TCP port 3493). Unfortunately the
upsmcd is not available under Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) OS. Still, we can connect to the `upsd` using telnet
and emulate the commands `upscmd` would send. The protocol is
described [here](https://networkupstools.org/docs/developer-guide.chunked/ar01s09.html). In our specific case we just
want to perform 3 actions (4 messages):

1. Login
    - `USERNAME <user>`
    - `PWD <pwd>`
2. Enable or disable the beeper
    - `INSTCMD <upsname> <command>`
3. Log out
    - `LOGOUT`

## Howto:

### 1. SSH into the NAS

Activate SSHd under the synology control panel if you haven't done so and SSH into it. Note: under windows you might
need a decent console with ssh (git bash?) or to use PuTTY.

```shell
ssh <username>@<nas_ip> -p <ssh_port>
```

### 2. Find user configuration file

The upsd.users file could be located in two places, find the needed one:

```shell
user@nas:/$ find /usr/syno/etc/ups/ /etc/ups/ -name "upsd.users"
(result /path/to/upsd.users)
```

### 3. Add a new user to upsd

Edit the upsd.users file (depending on file location according to the previous step) and add a new user account with
permissions to change the beeper status

For file inside _/usr/syno/etc/ups_

```shell
user@nas:/$ sudo vim /usr/syno/etc/ups/upsd.users
Password: <insert your pwd>
```

For file inside _/etc/ups_

```shell
user@nas:/$ sudo vim /etc/ups/upsd.users
Password: <insert your pwd>
```

Be careful with the VIM editor! In case you are not familiar with it:

* Move the cursor down <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> until you find the place where you want to add the new lines
* Press <kbd>I</kbd> to enter the INSERT MODE
* Edit the file as needed
* Press the <kbd>Esc</kbd> Key to leave the edit mode
* Press <kbd>:</kbd> to issue a command
* Write "wq" (write an quit) and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>

So, edit the upsd.users file and add a new user with privileges to enable/disable the beeper (replace `<upsd_username>`
and `<upsd_pwd>` with the desired values):

```shell
    [<upsd_username>]
        password = <upsd_pwd>
        actions = SET
        instcmds = beeper.enable beeper.disable ups.beeper.status
```

### 4. Restart the upsd service

```shell
sudo synosystemctl restart ups-usb
(wait a few seconds)
```

### 5. Create a python script to issue commands

Clone the `upscmd.py` and `ups_beeper_control.sh` to a folder in your NAS, e.g. `/volume1/homes/<user>/DisableBeeper/`

Edit the `upscmd.py` to set the `user` and `pwd`  with the previously created one in step 3.

### 6. Schedule it

Go to the DSM Web interface (Control panel → Task scheduler).

To **disable during boot**, add one Triggered task:

- User: root
- Event: Boot-up
- User-defined script:

```
cp /volume1/homes/<user>/DisableBeeper/upscmd.py /root/
cp /volume1/homes/<user>/DisableBeeper/ups_beeper_control.sh /root/
chmod u+x /root/upscmd.py
chmod u+x /root/ups_beeper_control.sh
bash /root/ups_beeper_control.sh disable
```

For **daily enabling and disable** add 3 tasks:

1. Scheduled task to enable beeper
    - User: root
    - Schedule: e.g. daily at 9am
    - User-defined script:

```
cp /volume1/homes/<user>/DisableBeeper/upscmd.py /root/
cp /volume1/homes/<user>/DisableBeeper/ups_beeper_control.sh /root/
chmod u+x /root/upscmd.py
chmod u+x /root/ups_beeper_control.sh
bash /root/ups_beeper_control.sh enable
```

2. Scheduled task to disable beeper
    - User: root
    - Schedule: e.g. daily at 9pm
    - User-defined script:

```
cp /volume1/homes/<user>/DisableBeeper/upscmd.py /root/
cp /volume1/homes/<user>/DisableBeeper/ups_beeper_control.sh /root/
chmod u+x /root/upscmd.py
chmod u+x /root/ups_beeper_control.sh
bash /root/ups_beeper_control.sh disable
```

3. Triggered task to enable / disable on boot based on the current time

- User: root
- Event: Boot-up
- User-defined script:

```
cp /volume1/homes/<user>/DisableBeeper/upscmd.py /root/
cp /volume1/homes/<user>/DisableBeeper/ups_beeper_control.sh /root/
chmod u+x /root/upscmd.py
chmod u+x /root/ups_beeper_control.sh
bash /root/ups_beeper_control.sh curtime
```

### 7. At this point you can test the scripts:

Select the created Disable task and click Run. Check the
result (Action → View Result), you should see:

```shell
disable beeper...
Connecting to UPS (attempt 1/10)...
USERNAME: OK
PASSWORD: OK
INSTCMD ups beeper.disable: OK

OK Goodbye
Waiting 5 seconds for UPS to update state...
Beeper disabled.
```
